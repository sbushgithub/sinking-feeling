<h1>Game Rules - Sinking Feeling</h1> 
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
	Battleship is a two-player game. Each player has a hidden board where they place ships prior to the start of the game. Once the game begins, players take turns firing shots at the opponent's board in at attempt to sink their ships. The first play to sink all of the opponent's ships wins.
</p>
<h3>Game Components</h3>
<p>
	A Battleship game has the following components:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li> 
		A game board for each player. A game board is a 10 by 10 grid that represents the area where a player's ships are placed. 
	</li>
	<ul type="circle">
		<li>
			Rows are labeled with letters, from top to bottom: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.
		</li>
		<li>
			Columns are labeled with numbers, from left to right: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
		</li>
		<li>
			Squares are labeled with their column and row. For example, the top right corner is A-10.
		</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>
		Five ships for each player. Each ship occupies a consecutive series of grid squares on the game board, either horizontally or vertically. The player's five ships have different sizes:
	</li>
	<ul type="circle">
		<li>
			One aircraft carrier, occupying 5 squares.
		</li>
		<li>
			One battleship, occupying 4 squares.
		</li>
		<li>
			Two cruisers, occupying 3 squares each.
		</li>
		<li>
			One destroyer, occupying 2 squares
		</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
	Each player may always see the placement of ships on their own game board. The placement of ships on the opponent's game board is initially a secret; occupied spaces are revealed during gameplay.
	Game Setup
</p>
<h3>Game Setup</h3>
	<p>
		At the start of game, each player is presented with their own game board. Their five ships are randomly placed on the board. The player may rearrange the ships to any configuration they want. Ships are not allowed to overlap and may not be placed diagonally. Ships are allowed to touch.
	</p>
	<p>
		When each player has arranged the ships to their liking, the game begins. Each player's board is frozen, preventing further ship movement. Each player also gains access to a concealed version of the opponent's board: they see the 10 by 10 grid, but no ship placement is visible. Players then begin to take turns.
	</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
	<p>
		The players must decide who goes first. Players alternate turns taking shots to try to hit the opponent's ships.
	</p>
	<p>
		To take a shot, a player selects a target square on their view of the opponent's board. If the square is not occupied as a ship, then it is a miss. If the square is occupied by a ship, then it is a hit. If all squares on a ship have been hit, then the ship is sunk. The results of the shot are presented on both players' versions of the opponent's board.
	</p>
	<p>
		When a player sinks a ship, the player is told which ship was sunk and which squares that ship occupied.
	</p>
	<p>
		If a player's shot sink's the opponent's final ship, then the player wins the game.
